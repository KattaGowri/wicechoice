          'The iPhone 15 Pro Max is a very versatile phone with professional cameras having 4 options of optical lenses of 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 5x and a macro lens option. It is better and more cost effective than having an SLR camera with many lens options, which you need to acquire. The charge lasts long enough for my filming videos of YouTube channel. Superb',

And when I used the phone earlier, the device gets too warm easily when I started to play games...and I contacted the Amazon and iOS support and told me to visit the service centre and the service centre is like 1-2 days far from my home location. This isn't something I expected. The phone is very expensive and I bought recently, just in 1-2 months the device isn't usable, it need to be trash now smh...The device isn't even charging now..",

          "I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.\n\nThe camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.\n\nIn essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.",
