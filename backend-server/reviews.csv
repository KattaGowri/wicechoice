"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience"
"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side, so though it is very good in all aspects, many people may find it very difficult to purchase ."
"DesignOne of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.DisplayThe iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.PerformanceThe iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.CameraThe iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.Battery lifeThe iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.ProsNew design with rounded edgesMore powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 proNew 48-megapixel main cameraBrighter display with upto 2000 nits brightnessUSB C can be used for anythingDynamic IslandConsNo 120hz displayNo Macro photography"
After so many follow ups finally received a product. Product is good
"It was a gift for my 16th bday, what would you expect, it‚Äôs an iPhone ofc it‚Äôs the best in class and has the best capabilities. If you‚Äôre thinking of buying it then just go for it, it is the best!"
"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy."
Running smoothly..no problem at all.Camera is good and battery life is also good manage one day charging..also charge with any type c charging.Worth it phone under this range.
Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn‚Äôt make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic
Apple iPhone quite costly but quite good interface and operations systemIf you have no issue with spending money this is product you can buy.
I like
Love it
Good camera quality
beautiful!!!!
good
You can found best apples in the forest of amazon only. Nice product.
"it‚Äôs the best smart phone ( based on personal preference ) available in the market , by all means it does justifies it‚Äôs hype.also got it at such a stealing price, thank you Amazonüôè"
This is my second apple order from Amazon. I've also directly ordered from Apple website and I can say that the product is genuine and exactly same as when I get from Apple website. Quick delivery and securely sealed. Kudos to Amazon for trustworthy delivery.
Nice phone
"Sound quality is very good. Performance is good and transfer of data from my old iPhone happened very fast. Software update was completed immediately after starting the phone . Only problem is that the charging cable is different and it doesn‚Äôt fit into USB port, so one must have an adapter or order one along with the iPhone."
I like it
100% ok
Delivery was satisfactorilyProduct was good and safe
Good price
Delivered on same day. Indian version. SBI promo did not work as mentioned. So opted for icici emi on amazon pay card. Nothing to say about iphone. There are plenty of reviews on that.
Authentic product and 5 star for secured delivery. The seller was genuine and trustworthy.
CAMERA EXCELLENT.Charger should be included.
What to tell about apple product security reasons excellent
""
As always apple products are over priced
""
"4* because there‚Äôs always room for improvement. For a phone that pricey, I expected it'll dance and come into my lap for unboxing"
iPhone is only Apple phone. No other wise phone comparative in market than iPhone.
"I've switched from iPhone 13 to 15 and this transition definitely feels worthwhile. Got this for 66,000 using my SBI credit card + ongoing offers on Amazon.The delivery was secure and the packaging was impenetrable. The device interface is user friendly and the camera......well it's iPhone so you already know."
This phone iphone 15 have not finger sensor
Overall good
All good but have little heating problem.
Fell to the peer pressure of my grown-up child.....
Like value for money
"At starting am hesitating to buy this much costly phone as I am android user and mostly I used android phones below 20k so am not able to take decision to buy or not but I purchased and now am very happy and not getting feeling like why I spend almost 80k for a phone because am enjoying ui interface and many iPhone functions and feel I didn‚Äôt purchase this brand for show off actually am big fan of Steve jobs and I like apple products so overall experience about this phone is awesome and am not getting any regret feeling camera is very good , battery backup also good ,user interface is awesome"
Excellent phone
This was my first iPhone using experience.iPhone is better the android .Only draw back is it drain battery fast.
Nice Buy
Experiencing first time üòçüòçüòç Everything is amazing
"Light weight,But battery is better working in 13"
Best iPhone in this price
Great performance
Good product
This phone is 5/5 but when you backup your WhatsApp full backup doesn‚Äôt happen and due to which I lot some of my data
"Overall very good product, specially long lasting battery, image & video quality, display quality are very clear."
happy with product
Nice mobile. Performance is awesome but pricey.
"Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about consBattery : worst than I expect . Many says it is iOS 17 behind poor battery life . Hardly 3-4 he if you travelling and your network changes frequently .. worst than my android devices .Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos üòÅiOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool tooPrice : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro"
"We are paying huge amount to buy iPhone but they are not coming up with innovative solutions control device heating, device heats up massively, sometimes I feels holding a nuclear plant in hand,"
"I had an interesting experience with the new model. The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‚ÄòFind My‚Äô app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn‚Äôt very tech-savvy and couldn‚Äôt figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it‚Äôs not going anywhere."
"Nice product, safely delivered"
"1. Good display -‚Ä¢ Peak brightness is good and good visibility even in broad day light.‚Ä¢ Clarity of the picture is good.2. Excellent camera update -‚Ä¢ Portrait mode pictures are great.‚Ä¢ Resolution of the picture has improved and can see more details.3. Dynamic island -‚Ä¢ As a first time experience, it is exiting to see a separated put notch hanging and videos playing around it. Gotta see its uses in long run.4. USB - C‚Ä¢ Gives us option to use other android chargers when needed. Great relief for apple users. Don‚Äôt have to be extra careful while packing :-P5. Colour - i bought it for my wife and pink colour was perfect.Note: This review is considering my previous phone was iphone 12."
Am a iPhone fan so no complaints‚Ä¶.
Overall it's okay except the heating issue. Device got automatically heated up after watching a video at high quality.I hope apple will fix it in upcoming updates.
Good quality of photos and videos. Quality of voice calling is good battery backup is good for normal phone user time over all my first this is my first I phone
"Amazing phone, great touch sensitivity"

Heating issues
"I love everything like color, touch, back side quality, camera, ultra fast process, etc., and what not?As always Apple rocks"
Everything is better than my iPhone 12 except cell reception which is way worse here
Got a very good deal and the model and variant is very Good.Thank you Amazon
Really loved the iPhone 15 :)
Camper quality goods
"The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade with improvements across the board. The design is sleek, the display is gorgeous, and the performance is top-notch. The camera takes stunning photos, and iOS 17 offers some exciting new features. While there are a few minor shortcomings, the overall experience is undeniably impressive."
iPhone 15 is faster and better looking than iPhone 12 .
Like all other iPhones with few new features.
Thank u amazone.
Wonderful product with good features. Worth to buy.
"Good-Battery is really goodPerformance is very goodAnd generally all okBad-Heating issue while charging. It heats up like anything, it will eventually affect battery health in long term. A big downside."
Hi‚Ä¶ I ordered new IPhone and received it yesterday‚Ä¶ heating a lot ..while transferring files from old phone
Excellent product. The main concern is while charging the mobile is going too hot. If you touch the mobile whole body is too heating.
Got it with a good offer on Amazon. I like the phone. Has a battery that lasts a day and photos are good.
everything is good but the seller did not keep his promise of Rs 5000 cash back
"Go for it guys , after 3 months of usage still I feel it"
"If you don‚Äôt like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won‚Äôt recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!"
Excellent performance where is my invoice and other formalities? Warranty is also not available .
Beautiful‚ù§ pictures
"Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new ios so dont worry it happens when you update to newer ios.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity."
There are some jitters and lags also have heating issue
Ok
For daily use
Nice phone.
"Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you‚Äôre willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won‚Äôt feel any difference if you‚Äôve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions."
Good
I was using iPhone 13 and switching to 15 was a good choice I guess! The phone have better camera than 13 as the lens are bigger with more megapixels also the Dynamic Island makes it more fun and engaging and the gaming experience is pretty smooth and amazing as it‚Äôs having iPhone 14 Pro Max chipset.
